## I want to report a bug or a problem about Lichess Mobile

[**Make an issue**](https://github.com/lichess-org/mobile/issues/new).
Before creating an issue, make sure that:

1. You list the steps to reproduce the problem to show that other users may
experience it as well, if the issue is not self-descriptive.
2. Search to make sure it isn't a duplicate. [The advanced search syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) may come in handy.
3. It is not a trivial problem or demands unrealistic dev time to fix. Such
issues may be closed.
4. You provide device hardware and operating system information to help with the
debug.
