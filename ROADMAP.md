# Roadmap

This is not a real roadmap but a simple list of features that are actually planned, in no particular order.

If a feature is missing here, it does not mean we won't implement it. It just mean it has a lower priority and will probably wait for the other to be done.

Some of the planned features are also described in the Issues, these ones have usually higher priority.
