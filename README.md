# Lichess Mobile

Second iteration of the [Lichess mobile app](https://lichess.org/mobile).

## How to contribute

The project is still in early stage of development. Drastic changes may still
happen, including project structure.

If you want to contribute, please read the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Setup

Follow the [flutter guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
to install flutter on your operating system.

This project is meant to run on iOS and Android, so you need to follow the
"Platform setup" section of that guide to install the iOS and/or Android platform.

Note that this project is not meant to be run on web platform.

### Local lila

You will need a local [lila](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila) (lichess server scala app) instance to work on this
project. You will also need to setup [lila-ws](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila-ws) (websocket server).

Instructions to install both are found in [the lila wiki](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/wiki).

The mobile application is configured by default to target `http://127.0.0.1:9663` and `ws://127.0.0.1:9664`, so keep these when installing lila.


## Run

First run the code generator:

```
dart run build_runner watch
```

Then use flutter run:

flutter run
```
